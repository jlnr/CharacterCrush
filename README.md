#  Character Crush

## Next Steps

There is always more to do. Here are a few ideas that didn't make it in time:

* Online highscore using Apple's free GameCenter API.
* Remember last selected difficulty level.
* Support [other tone color schemes than Pleco's](http://laowaichinese.net/tone-colors-and-what-pleco-did-with-them.htm) in `Hanzi+RenderToTexture.swift`.
* Replace SpriteKit with plain UIKit (except maybe for particle effects?).
  The physics engine has caused lots of trouble (it never lets tiles come to rest), and some effects don't work in the simulator (e.g. `SKShapeNode.strokeTexture`).
