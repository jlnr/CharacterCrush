#  Character Crush

## Next Steps

There is always more to do. Here are a few ideas that didn't make it in time:

* Online highscore using Apple's free GameCenter API.
* Remember last selected difficulty level.
* Support [other tone color schemes than Pleco's](http://laowaichinese.net/tone-colors-and-what-pleco-did-with-them.htm) in `Hanzi+RenderToTexture.swift`.
* Replace SpriteKit with plain UIKit (except maybe for particle effects).
  Despite lots of tweaking, the physics engine never lets our tiles come to rest after falling down, which leads visual artefacts, and needlessly drains the battery.
